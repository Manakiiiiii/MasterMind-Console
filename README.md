# MasterMind-Console
MasterMind
• The game of mastermind is played with 6 colors of pegs (e.g. Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple) • The code maker creates a code consisting of 4 pegs.  Duplicates are allowed. • The code breaker creates a guess consisting of 4 pegs.  The code maker responds to the guess using smaller pegs:  black (when a correct color is in the correct place) and white (when a correct color is in an incorrect place). • If the guess is correct (4 black responses), then the game is over and the code breaker has won. • Otherwise, the code breaker guesses again. • After 8 guesses, the code maker has won, and the code is revealed.
